# RBCE Project

This project aims to develop a webpage for an ONG - Rede Brasileira de Cooperação de Emergências. Our goal is to create a platform that facilitates communication and engagement with the community, as well as promotes the initiatives and projects of RBCE. We use HTML, CSS, and Tailwind to structure and style the site. TypeScript and React are used to develop dynamic and interactive functionalities.

### How to Run the Application

1. Clone the project from GitHub:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bc-fullstack-04/samuel-deotti-frontend.git
    ```
   or
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:bc-fullstack-04/samuel-deotti-frontend.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd rbce
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

5. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

6. Wait for a new tab to open in your browser, or open it manually. The application usually runs on port 5173, but it may open on a different port. If you encounter issues, check the terminal for the specified port.
    ```bash
    http://localhost:5173/
    ```

### How to Stop the Frontend Application

To stop the application, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where the server is running.
